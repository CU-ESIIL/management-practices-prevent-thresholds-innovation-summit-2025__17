# Identifying linked disturbances and associated management intervenetions to prevent tipping points

<!-- =========================================================

**One sentence on impact:** Using the ICS database we are identifying whether ecological disturbances have overlapped in the U.S. and if there are intervention straetegies that can mitigate the impacts of linked disturabnce.

> **About this site:** This public log captures our rapid work at the Innovation Summit. Update it directly in your browser (open a file → pencil icon → Commit changes) so teammates and partners can follow along.

## How to use this page (for the team)
- **Edit this file:** `docs/index.md` → ✎ → change text → **Commit changes**.
- **Add images:** upload to `docs/assets/` and reference like `assets/your_file.png`.
- Keep **text short** and **visuals first**. Think “slide captions,” not essays.

## Day 1 — Define & Explore
*Focus: Exploring where the relevance of linked disturbance

### Our product 📣
- A synthesis manuscript and high level dataset of forest management actions (maybe a map or something)

### Our question(s) 📣
- What management actions take place after drought, windstorm, fire, and insect/path to prevent future wildfires?
-Ie. how are managers purposefully or inadvertently breaking disturbance links in order to prevent future catastrophic disturbances and tipping points?

### Hypotheses / intentions 📣
-We expect to have a ton of fun and learn a lot :_

### Why this matters (the “upshot”) 📣
-Disturbances can facilitate others. If disturbances are becoming more common with climate change, we might be able to intervene once a disturbance occurs to prevent further loss of ecosystem and life.


### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: 
- Dataset portal: St. Denis, L.A., Mietkiewicz, N.P., Short, K.C., Buckland, M. and Balch, J.K., 2020. All-hazards dataset mined from the US National Incident Management System 1999–2014. Scientific data, 7(1), p.64.
- Tool/tech: 

### Field notes / visuals



> **Different perspectives:** Ranching partners emphasized socio-economic thresholds (labor, funding) alongside ecological ones; we parked those for future integration.

## Day 2 — Data & Methods
*Focus: Compiling incident reports within 20 km area to identify potential linked and compound effects

### Data sources we’re exploring 📣
<!-- EDIT: Link each source; add size/notes if relevant. -->
- **Source A**
- https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/All-hazards_dataset_mined_from_the_US_National_Incident_Management_System_1999-2020/19858927/3

- Source B — link and 1-line description

### Methods / technologies we’re testing 📣
- Compiling data via R
- Mapping overlapping incidents throughout the US

### Challenges identified
- Data gaps / quality issues
- Method limitations / compute constraints
- Open questions we need to decide on

### Visuals
#### Static figure

#### Interactive map (iframe)

## Final Share Out — Insights & Sharing
*Focus: synthesis; highlight 2–3 visuals that tell the story; keep text crisp. Practice a 2-minute walkthrough of the homepage 📣: Why → Questions → Data/Methods → Findings → Next.*

### Findings at a glance 📣
<!-- EDIT: 2–4 bullets, each a headline in plain language with a number if possible. -->
- Headline 1 — what, where, how much
- Headline 2 — change/trend/contrast
- Headline 3 — implication for practice or policy

### Visuals that tell the story 📣
<!-- EDIT: Swap visuals; prioritize clarity. -->

[Raw photo location: fire_hull.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/management-practices-prevent-thresholds-innovation-summit-2025__17/blob/main/docs/assets/fire_hull.png)
*Visual 1.* Swap in the primary graphic that clearly communicates your core takeaway.

![Supporting panels for key insights](assets/hull_panels.png)
[Raw photo location: hull_panels.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/management-practices-prevent-thresholds-innovation-summit-2025__17/blob/main/docs/assets/hull_panels.png)
*Visual 2.* Use a complementary panel, collage, or set of snapshots that reinforces supporting evidence.

[Raw photo location: main_result.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/management-practices-prevent-thresholds-innovation-summit-2025__17/blob/main/docs/assets/main_result.png)
*Visual 3.* Highlight an additional visual that captures a secondary insight or next step.
